# Insertion Sort Visualizer
A real-time visualization of the Insertion Sort algorithm built with C++ and SDL2. This project provides an interactive, step-by-step graphical demonstration of how insertion sort organizes data, making it perfect for students and developers learning about sorting algorithms.

This project visualizes the QuickSort algorithm in real time, showing how data is recursively partitioned and sorted. Built in C++ with the SDL2 library, it provides a step-by-step graphical demonstration aimed at making sorting algorithms easier to understand for students and developers.

## Features
🎯 Visual Algorithm Learning - See how insertion sort works step-by-step<br>
🌈 Color-Coded Visualization - Different colors for current element, comparison element, and sorted bars<br>
📊 Real-time Animation - Smooth animations showing element movements<br>
🎲 Random Data Generation - Creates 100 random numbers (1-99) for each run<br>
📈 Descending Order Sort - Sorts from largest to smallest<br>
⏱️ Adjustable Speed - Configurable animation delay for better visualization<br>
🖥️ Cross-Platform - Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux<br>


### Watch the inspiration video!
Watch the algorithm in action! This visualization is inspired by educational sorting algorithm demonstrations.
