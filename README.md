# Welcome
This project is a part of multiple similar projects that visualize the process of how algorithms sort data, this one would be showing how Insertion Sort would organize a set of data. 
It was made with sdl2, a c++ library which let me open up a window and visualize the whole process to the screen.

This project visualizes the QuickSort algorithm in real time, showing how data is recursively partitioned and sorted. Built in C++ with the SDL2 library, it provides a step-by-step graphical demonstration aimed at making sorting algorithms easier to understand for students and developers.

## Features
🎯 Visual Algorithm Learning - See how insertion sort works step-by-step<br>
🌈 Color-Coded Visualization - Different colors for current element, comparison element, and sorted bars<br>
📊 Real-time Animation - Smooth animations showing element movements<br>
🎲 Random Data Generation - Creates 100 random numbers (1-99) for each run<br>
📈 Descending Order Sort - Sorts from largest to smallest<br>
⏱️ Adjustable Speed - Configurable animation delay for better visualization<br>
🖥️ Cross-Platform - Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux<br>
